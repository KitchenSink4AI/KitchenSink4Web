"""Guarded execution of CALLER-SUPPLIED regex patterns.

Ported from KitchenSink4Word `ops/_regex.py` by way of KS4XL `core/_regex.py`,
and placed under policy/ here because it is a resource-consumption control
rather than a text utility.

A valid but pathological pattern ((a+)+c against long 'aaaa...' text) can
backtrack for hours; the server is single-threaded stdio, so one bad pattern
denies service to the whole session. Every user-supplied pattern therefore
runs through the `regex` module with a hard timeout. Internal patterns built
from re.escape() are safe and keep using stdlib re.

**This guard matters more in the browser domain than it did in the document
family** (PLAN 1.1). `find_elements` takes a caller-supplied pattern and runs
it against PAGE TEXT, which means the text side of the match is attacker
influenced as well as the pattern side. A page that wants to hang the agent
can supply the 'aaaa...' half for free.

Shipped from Phase 0 so the guard exists before any search path does.
